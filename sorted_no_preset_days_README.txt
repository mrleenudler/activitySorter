
Takes in an Excel file from Forms with applications for multiple activities independent of days.
Days are manually set in the code.
The program sorts the applications and tries to place students according to their wishes.
If students have applied for activities that are all on the same day, they'll be listed in the "unassigned.docx" file
The program will look for duplicate applications, but they must be deleted manually from the Excel file.
(If one of the duplicate entries have a misspelled name, the duplicate detector will fail)
Specific hack is implemented for "Kino i hall 2" which is running on two days. This can be changed or expanded in the code as needed.
Specific hack is implementet to prioritize "Python for de som kan litt fra f√∏r" because this activity had few applications. This can be removed or expanded as needed.
